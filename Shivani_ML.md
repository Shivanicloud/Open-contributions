MACHINE LEARNING
Basically,ML is a machine which is a branch of AI.also it already has its own program which is then modified and put forward to make a real model.basically it's a pattern based language in which pattern is consists of clusters(collection of similar things) 
Key terminologies involved are:
1)converting data into information 
2)solving problem 
3)implementing the problem 

Types of ml
1)supervised:-basically in these method system already know what is the output
2)unsupervised:-system don't have any idea about the o/p
3)reinforcement:- it's based on reward and feedback

Beyond this I don't have any idea about ML I know the terms like regression and all but I don't have deep idea about it.
